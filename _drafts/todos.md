# I tracked my Todo List for one year – here's what I found

- Text list
- Analysed that data with Jekyll and Google Spreadsheets
- total tasks

## I'm using my todo list on 75% of my working days

I'm not too disciplined, but thats fine
Still on paper
And Trello

## I have a median of 10 tasks per day, of which I finish 7. 

So you think, 7 tasks would be perfect, right?

## I finish 78% of my tasks per day

No matter if my day is busy or not

## I cancel only 3℅ of my tasks

I thought it was much more!

## Monday is the busiest day, Tuesday the most productive

with 12 tasks of which I managed to do 9, went down to 8 on friday, of which I only done 6. Relative productivity highest on Tuesday with 78%

## Most of my tasks are about Meetings and Feedback

my biggest project in 2016 was launching Bubble Island 2

## Short task descriptions are good

The shorter the task description, the more likely it is to be finished. But not too short!

## Tasks I finish are …

I tend to drag on Meetings and sending updates.
