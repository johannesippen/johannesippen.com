# I tracked my Todo List for one year – here's what I found

- Text list
- Analysed that data with Jekyll and Google Spreadsheets
- total tasks

## I'm using my todo list on 75% of my working days

I don't use my Todo list every day. Even after counting out all vacations, public holidays and off-site events, I found that I'm only using it 3 out of 4 days. At first, I found that quite shocking. Do I really have that little discipline?

The answer is no. I'm still using Trello with my team for our project coordination, and some days, that's enough. I would also work with lists on paper every now and than, mostly for meeting notes or quick todos. 

So overall, not using my todo list every day is pretty alright, however I'm trying to be more disciplined this year.

## I have a median of 10 tasks per day, of which I finish 7. 

7 out of 10. No bad number. The magic number. Wait! This basically tells me that I'm having too many tasks in my list. If I'm focussing on 7 tasks per day, I would manage to finish all of them, right?

Actually, there is apps that are suggesting this. Like XXX. But then I digged deeper and found:

## I finish 78% of my tasks per day

My actually average of finished tasks per day is 78%, which is a bit higher than 7 out 10. Math! The surprising thing: This ratio is pretty stable, no matter how many tasks I had per day. Even on busy days with 15 and more tasks I managed to get around 78% done, the same for slow days with only 2 or 3 three tasks – one would always slip or get postponed. 

## I cancel only 3℅ of my tasks

Just to remember: My tasks can have three states: Open, Done or Canceled. Sometimes I would cancel a task, for example if somebody else did it or project requirements changed. Canceling tasks is necessary and something I would recommend to everyone.

Before I did my statistic, it felt like everyday I would cancel at least one task, however it was much much less. Only 3% of my daily work would get killed in the making - not too bad!

## Monday is the busiest day, Tuesday the most productive

with 12 tasks of which I managed to do 9, went down to 8 on friday, of which I only done 6. Relative productivity highest on Tuesday with 78%

## Most of my tasks are about Meetings and Feedback

my biggest project in 2016 was launching Bubble Island 2

## Short task descriptions are good

The shorter the task description, the more likely it is to be finished. But not too short!

## Tasks I finish are …

I tend to drag on Meetings and sending updates.
