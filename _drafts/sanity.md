## Dont start a series

TV or Netflix series can eat up so much time – and once you started, you have to binge until the end.

When I was writing my diploma thesis, my girlfriend was the biggest fan of JJ Abrahm’s series Lost. All she was talking about was Hurley, the others and what else was going on the island. I had a hard time catching up – and no time to start watching the show at all.

Luckily, I discovered this video:

Lost in 7 minutes – 5 seasons condensed to the bare essentials, just enough to satisfy my urge of knowing what the fuzz is about and to pretend you’d be an avid watcher.

Watching a summary does not only bring you up to speed, in best case it also spoils a complete series for and will keep you from starting it at all. In case of lost, this saved me XX hours. Here’s another one for Game of Thrones:

Congrats, you just saved yourself XX hours of dragons, boobs and Peter Dinklage. You are welcome.

## Consume while creating

Let’s face it: we can't totally avoid consuming things on the internet. The temptation is too present. To still get some work done, try the following trick: Consume while creating. I know artists you watch shows on a second screen while they color their illustrations or do shading works. I’m listening to podcasts while coding.

My trick: I keep a playlist with things that I only listen to when doing certain works – the "Watch Later" function of Youtube is your friend. Playlists in general can be a great tool for your creativity – check this out.

Do you have issues keeping a balance between breathing in and exhaling? How do you keep yourself from getting carried away into the internet? Any tools or tricks you would like to share with me on Twitter? Thank you for reading my article, I hope you liked it. And now, back to work!
