# Pathway to Sanity

This is something that has always been on my mind and that I always wanted to write, but never really had a good approach on how to write it. Until I saw this tweet by amazing designer and procrastiworker Jessica Hische:

> Make a promise to yourself to not spend more time consuming content online than you spend creating it. Pathway to sanity. – Jessica Hische

Welcome to 2017. The machines that we do our work on are also the biggest source of entertainment we have on our hands: Youtube, Facebook, Buzzfeed, Netflix. Never in the history of mankind have work and leisure been closer together than today. We don’t differentiate between Work terminals and home entertainment systems, everthing we need in life runs on our Macbooks or Surfaces.

The blur between work and entertainment can be a great risk and requires a lot of self-discipline. How do you make sure you don’t get soaked up into the crazy world of entertainment?

- spending time online
- bad feeling: just watched, didnt work

## Put yourself in flight mode

Don't even get into temptation. If you can afford it, turn off Wifi on your computer and set your phone to flight mode. This of course implies that you don't need any online tool for doing your work – and only works for real offline jobs.

Realistically, at some point you'll need to go back online. So try to do it for a limited amount of time. A "disconnected hour" per day could work pretty well.

## Turn off notifications

If you can’t turn off the connections to the outside, at least deactivate your notifications. This might sound scary at first: Am I not going to miss an important email? What if my colleague waits forever for my reply on Slack? How do I know somebody commented on my Instagram?

I've deactived Slack notification over a year ago, it works like a charm. You would wonder how many problems solve themselve if you give people a couple of minutes to think about it and figure a solution on their own. Try to see it like this: If they have a really burning question, they will walk over to your desk (or call you if you’re not in the same office space) anyway.

Find fixed times for dealing with email and and Social Media. Instantly replying to notifications is probably the biggest source of distraction we have in our modern times. 

## Restart your browser

This is an easy one: Just shut down Chrome and restart it completely. Not only will your computer run much faster without the many opened tabs, but also you will automagically get rid of all the pages that you kept open to "read them later".

It’s not only the fact that we consume things instead of creating them, it's also the intend and the plan to do so – a fresh start every now and then can do wonders and help to focus. Also, this will log you out of Facebook every now and then, which can’t be bad.

## Dont start a series

Series. Oh man. 

- not movies but series

## Consume while creating

- podcasts
- watching things

Matthew Inman, better known as The Oatmeal compared [creativity once as breathing](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/creativity): when you create, you exhale. You can't exhale forever – you need to breathe in at some point. This is when you read, when go outside or when you just relax and entertain yourself. Netflix and chill. But where is the border?
