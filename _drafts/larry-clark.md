# What designers can learn from director icon Larry Clark

“When you're young, not much matters. When you find something that you care about, then that's all you got.” Even when you don't know who Larry Clark is, you might remember this quote from his cult movie Kids. Highly provocative, "Kids" was the most authentic depiction of youth cult, drug culture and skateboarding at the time. With unknown actors, real locations, rough dialogues and intimate camera angles, Larry Clark anticipated the Youtube culture – almost 2 decades before it took of the ground.

What I never knew and impressed me the most about Kids is that Larry Clark was not one of them. At the time he shot the movie, he hit the 50 already. With a former career as a professional drug addict and mildly successful photographer, he reinvented himself as a filmmaker.

Today, Lary Clark is 73 years old and still an active filmer. Last year, he gave an interview to DAZED, nicely named as "The Manifesto for not giving a fuck". Reading this article, I observed a lot of behaviours on how I approach designing side projects and actually gathered some really valuable learnings from the manifesto.

Here is my favourites:

## Be flexible!

When faced with drunk and striking actors during shooting "The Smell of Us", it seemed like this project was about to fail. Instead of giving up or postponing the filming, Larry Clark rewrote the second part of that movie and finished it.

Changing the project parameters when the circumstances or requirements change is a very important skill for creatives on any kind of project. We fall in love way to easily with a certain way of doing things or handling a project, being able to adopt from time to time can really help to focus on releasing a product.

When we worked on the Aside Magazine in 2011, Mobile Safari would crash if you used more than one webfont – nobody knew why, we only knew that this killed our beautiful design ideas. Instead of giving up, we switched to a combination of webfont and system font – and saved the project.

## Take as long as it takes!

You can't always be as flexible, some projects just take longer than expected. That should not be a reason to quit. The Aside Magazine was scheduled to take us 6 weeks, we only released it 10 months after we estimated this timeframe. We were just really bad at estimating workload back than.

Take this as a learning opportunity and transfer those learnings onto later projects.

## Embed yourself!

Larry Clark learned how to skate when he was 47, 48 years old for a photo project about skateboard kits. "You can’t just run and chase them, you have to skate with them to keep up", allowing him to get a whole different view on the subculture that would eventually result in the movie "Kids".

Getting to know your audience and embedding yourself in their lifestyle is an amazing lesson. Use your product, adapt the behavoiurs of and procedures that your audience uses.

Imagine this almost like the way a method actor would immerse into a role – method designing, if you will.

## Do it for yourself!

There is no sense in pursuing a product if you can't identify with its purpose, ideas and principles. If you don't like the thing you're working on, you won't be able to do a good job.

Often this is the case with products that you create for a completely different demographic or and audience with a very opposed mindset. If you do a sideproject, don’t put up the burden of having to deal with people you can't identify with. Start with doing a project for yourself!

## Welcome outside influence!

People get influenced by people. Larry Clark was influenced by artists like Lenny Bruce and Bob Dylan. Identify your heroes and allow their influence in your work. 

Get feedback, often and broadly. Welcome critical as well as positive feedback. Form a group of peers that you can show things and gather feedback from – tools like Slack, Wake or even WhatsApp make that extremely easy today.

## Trust your visions!

Okay, that's a tough one. You have this thing, this idea, and you feel very lonely with it. There’s no way to describe it as "Uber for X" or "Like Spotify, but …". And that is a good thing.

> "no one had ever made a film like that. I was just overwhelmed. I said, ‘This guy sees like I see.’"

When you have a clear vision of what you're after, keep doing it. Don't quit because no one understands your idea. Pursue it until you find a way of making people understand. Don’t be trendy, don't try to XX your idea. Trust your vision!
- keep doing it
- dont be trendy

## Stay Busy!

This is a bit like sport. If you stop practicing, if you stop exercising, you will lose shape.

> “I just try to keep busy. Robert Frank made a film once called Keep Busy. That’s a great title and a great thing to do in you life: just keep busy! Try and stay in some kind of shape, that’s what I’m doing – I’m just keeping busy, super busy.”

If you're creating, you need to keep creating. Make it part of your daily routine. Create something everyday. No matter what you do, if you design, if you photograph, if you draw or paint, if you code or write. Keep busy, do something everyday. Keep a journal or post to your instagram if it helps, take on a challenge that forces some peer pressure on you – staying in your creative shape will not only make you a better and more consistent designer, it will also keep you happy.
