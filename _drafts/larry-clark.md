# What designer can learn from director icon Larry Clark

“When you're young, not much matters. When you find something that you care about, then that's all you got.” Even when you don't know who Larry Clark is, you might remember this quote from his cult movie Kids. Highly provocative, "Kids" was the most authentic depiction of youth cult, drug culture and skateboarding at the time. With unknown actors, real locations, rough dialogues and intimate camera angles, Larry Clark anticipated the Youtube culture – almost 2 decades before it took of the ground.

What I never knew and impressed me the most about Kids is that Larry Clark was not one of them. At the time he shot the movie, he hit the 50 already. With a former career as a professional drug addict and mildly successful photographer, he reinvented himself as a filmmaker.

Today, Lary Clark is 73 years old and still an active filmer. Last year, he gave an interview to DAZED, nicely named as "The Manifesto for not giving a fuck". And you know what – there's a lot of things that designers can learn from it.

## Do it for yourself!

## Trust your visions!

> "no one had ever made a film like that. I was just overwhelmed. I said, ‘This guy sees like I see.’"

- keep doing it
- dont be trendy

## Stay Busy!

> “I just try to keep busy. Robert Frank made a film once called Keep Busy. That’s a great title and a great thing to do in you life: just keep busy! Try and stay in some kind of shape, that’s what I’m doing – I’m just keeping busy, super busy.”

- if you're creating, you need to keep creating
- it's like excerising

## Take as long as it takes!
