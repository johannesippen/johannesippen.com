# Is VR the new Flash?

According to Mark Twain, history does not repeat – yet it does rhyme. A while ago, I held a talk called "Breaking the Web", centering around popups got replaced by modals and Flash website intros reincarnated in parallax scrolljacking.

Looking back at university, I always had a difficult relationship with Flash. While I liked the fact how you could visually animate and script digital designs, I really disliked the heavy, soggy outcome. Text copy set in 6px pixel fonts, websites that where so heavy it took them several minutes to load and the pure abandonce of web standards. I was so much in disagree with Flash that I intentionally failed my Flash course in university – zero points.

This was right before HTML5 came to the rescue and Steve Jobs announced that Flash wouldn’t be making it to the then-new iPhone. Shortly after that announcement, I started working on the Aside Magazine – fully made in HTML5.

But back to VR: Think about it for a moment, it's an incredibly hyped topic right now, and almost every serious designer is trying to do something in that space. And actually, it shares more commonalities with Flash than first meet the eye:

## It's a closed, propietary system

To date, there is no existing open standard for the development of VR. There is no design patterns, no hardware specs or ISO standards. Every developer builds their own implementation of VR – and they are all closed, incompatible systems.

There is first signs of collaborations between device vendors, but no established platform yet – although Facebook is trying with Oculus really hard at the moment. But yet, what they are aiming for is a quasi-standard – not something that has been established under stakeholder agreement.

The same happened with Flash back in the days: There were other animation plugins on the market, only Flash was the most widespread one - and thus became a quasi-standard, altough it never an official spec.

## VR is extremely hardware-hungry

Who ever got his battery drowned by a flash site or early Youtube video knows what I'm talking about. Flash was killer to my 2007er Macbook CPU and cut the battery lifetime short by half. If you where on an older computer, the fancy Flash website would become just unusably flaky and slow.

While this is not an issue for Flash sites anymore, it has become one for VR: getting a headset to deliver a high quality video image at at least 60fps to avoid nausea – twice, one for each eye – is definitely still a challenge. So much that there is currently no Mac setup which supports Oculus. Sorry, fellow designers!

If you want to jump in to the VR game right now, a 5-6k gamer PC should be the least you can chip in!

## Designer are facing new design challenges

Designing for VR is much more than 

- Wow, clickbaity headline.
- Mark Twain said "History does not repeat itself, but it rhymes"
- I did a talk
- VR hyped
- Just like Adobe Flash
- I failed in Flash class, going to HTML5
- Think about it
- Same symptoms
- Closed propietary systems
- VR is extremely hardwarehungry
- We are facing new design challenges
- Learning new techniques
- Risk of misusing VR (3D navigation)
- Unusable experience monsters like Boo.com
- Could it still be a thing?
- Study from Vox Institue: 79% alone time
- Standards through WebVR
- Risk of going there, but we can avoid
- Looking forward to the challenge!
