# Is VR the new Flash?

- Wow, clickbaity headline.
- Mark Twain said "History does not repeat itself, but it rhymes"
- I did a talk
- VR hyped
- Just like Adobe Flash
- I failed in Flash class, going to HTML5
- Think about it
- Same symptoms
- Closed propietary systems
- VR is extremely hardwarehungry
- We are facing new design challenges
- Learning new techniques
- Risk of misusing VR (3D navigation)
- Unusable experience monsters like Boo.com
- Could it still be a thing?
- Study from Vox Institue: 79% alone time
- Standards through WebVR
- Risk of going there, but we can avoid
- Looking forward to the challenge!
