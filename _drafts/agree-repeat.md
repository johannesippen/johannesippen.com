# The Most Simple Approach to Branding

What makes a great brand? Is it the logo, the corporate design or the values and experiences we connect with it? Why do we, when we see the Nike Swoosh or the bitten Apple think about achievement, power and sophistication rather than sneakers and smartphones? What turns a product or a company into a lifestyle paradigm, into something that we recognize, follow, identify with and eventually fall in love with? 

The topic of branding has been widely covered. Thousands of books, agencies and designers are trying to find answers for these questions. Trying to create the perfect timeless brand. We're looking up to designer like Saul Bass or Paul Rand, trying to find these answers, just to find out that a great brand is more than it’s graphic design. Creating a brand is a process, and the quality of that process determines the output. All great brands share some similarities in this process, and in this article, I want to explore them.

If you’re a designer, marketing dude or startup founder, this article is for you. If you’re looking into creating a brand or planning a redesign, this article is for you. If you work with an existing brand, be it in a big company, a startup, an agency or just for yourself, this article is for you.

It is almost embarrasing to say how simple and obvious this approach is. The goal of this is not to replace existing techniques or claim the ultimative truth. Furthermore, it should be a foundation or a framework for your own efforts. It should be a reminder of what makes branding great. And: It is insanely simple. So simple, that it consists of only two steps: Agree and Repeat.

## Step One: Agree

- Anecdote

You start with defining with what makes your brand. You might start with your brand values, core principles, your main differentiors, mission statement or objectives. No matter which of those you start with, you will try to answer the question: Why? Why does our brand exist, why are we doing what we do? 

A great technique to do this is Simon Sinek’s "Golden Circles" technique, in which you define the Why, the How and the What of what you are doing with your brand. 

You will continue with the visual and tonal manifestion of your values: What does the logo look like, what kind of colors, typefaces and design elements will we use, what is the tone of voice in our communication, our visual language and behaviours as a company?

The importance about all of this: just defining these things is not enough. You need to agree on them.

Get all stakeholder on the table, include them in the discussion and let them have a say. If you have a point that you cannot get agreement on, it should not become part of your brand. This is a point that I had to learn over the years: No matter what you do, only the things that get full stakeholder buy-in will be accepted as part of the brand. If you force something on people or simple say "Let's see how this goes", you can be certain that it will not have longevity in your brand.

Stakeholder buy-in does not mean design by commitee. It shall not mean that you discuss every bit and end up with a compromise. Aim for a consensus. If you have a point that your stakeholders don’t agree on fully, suggest a couple of alternatives. If you cannot agree on one alternative, leave it out. There is many world-renowned brands that are missing one or two elements. Apple never had a company color. Britney Spears had a new logo for every album. Yet they are wildly successful brands: The other parts of their branding are so strong that they make up for the missing elements. Rather than having a fully defined brand set, focus on the really strong points.

How big the group of stakeholders is depends on the dimension of your brand. If you’re bootstrapping a startup or working on a sideproject, it’s basically just you. You can and should get external feedback, but you only need to get your own full buy-in on what is part of your brand and what not. If you have a team, everyone who is working with your brand is a stakeholder. This includes your board, the marketing team, your PR representant, Sales, but also Pam from Frontdesk who is responsible for ordering branded stationary. If you work a lot with external partners like agencies, subcontractors or publisher, they are part of your stakeholder group.

Use brand guidelines to nail down what you agreed on. This might be a style guide, brand guidelines, a style manifesto or a tone guide. They all have slightly different directions, advantages and disadvantages. No matter which format you choose, make sure that people use it. Avoid the big binder format that ends up setting dust in somewhere in a shelf in the Marketing Office. Go for a one-pager, something that is publicly available and easy to access. At Wooga, we created a webpage that we called wooga.com/logo. As so many people associate the logo with the brand, we took advantage of this bias and sneaked a full, very basic styleguide onto that page – including a full color palette, typographic guidelines and downloads. The hardest part is to choose and what to leave out: Do people really need a DO and DONT section for the logo usage? Do we really need a black and white TIFF version of it? Do we need to show how it should be used on letterhead stationary if we will probably never print one? The less fuss you remove, the more likely it will be that people use it.

XXX had a great idea about that: Instead of doing a One-Size-Fits-All styleguide, they serve different styleguides for different audiences – more work for you, but probably worth the effort.

Personally, I try to create a most minimalistic version of a styleguide for every project I'm working on – usually from the very beginning. This way I have something to guide me, without the effort of creating a big one. But that is a different article, that I will probably write at some point in the future.

Your key take-away for Step 1:
- Agree, don’t just define
- Get every stakeholder’s buy-in
- If you can't agree, leave it out
- Use styleguides to manifest the brand
- Make the styleguide usable and accessible

## Step Two: Repeat

- Quote



- Seems obvious
- Stick to the guide
- whatever you do
- there might be uncertanties
- try it out before
- defend and educate
- a good brand gets only acknowledged after it has been exposed so and so many times
- brand penetration
- Catch in Stakeholders and hold them accountable

- If you can't repeat properly, you made a mistake in Agreeing
- Use feedback tools like Wake
- Update Styleguide if necessary
- Extend, don't throw over

- All Branding is Agree & Repeat.
- What is your take?
