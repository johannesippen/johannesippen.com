# The Most Simple Approach to Branding

- Lots has been written
- Million ways
- Hopw to do it right?
- Most simple principle
- two columns: Agree & Repeat
- Might seem obvious
- Maybe you're a startup?
- Maybe you're redesigning?

## Step One: Agree

- Define what makes your brand
- You might start with Values, Principles, a Mission or Objectives
- Answer the question why?
- And How
- Follow Visual part: colors, logos, typefaces
- Just defining is not enough
- Get all stakeholders on the table
- Let them agree on the thing
- Rule of thumb: Only things that everyone can agree on are part of your brand
- If ppl don't agree on one thing, don't make it part of your brand
- How ig the group of stakeholders is depends on your brand
- if you're a bootstrapping startup, it might be only you
- if you have a team, everyone working with/on the brand might have a voice
- if you work a lot with external partners like agencies, subcontractors it might be them
- Agreeing is not democracy. This is not design by committee. Make suggestions and let people agree. Get their Buy-in.
- Styleguide to manifest
- Make sure people use it
- No big binder, one-pager maybe.
- Example for great styleguide
- The simplest styleguide. Other story.

## Step Two: Repeat

- Seems obvious
- Stick to the guide
- whatever you do
- there might be uncertanties
- try it out before
- defend and educate
- a good brand gets only acknowledged after it has been exposed so and so many times
- brand penetration
- Catch in Stakeholders and hold them accountable
- Story of Wooga cofounder who didn't like purple
- If you can't repeat properly, you made a mistake in Agreeing
- Use feedback tools like Wake
- Update Styleguide if necessary
- Extend, don't throw over

- All Branding is Agree & Repeat.
- What is your take?
