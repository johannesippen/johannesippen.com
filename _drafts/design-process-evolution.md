# Design Process Evolution

Great products don’t get cranked out – they’re a result of structured work. Starting with a briefing and diving right might look very courageous, but sure won’t bring you far. Product design is not about immersive dedication, it is about great process.

- personal story

What does a good design process look like? How to get it right? And what can we learn from successful agencies and tech companies like Apple? 

Over the years, design process have developed and evolved, coming from a very straight and formal process to the fast-paced agile methods we know and use today.

# Industry Model

It might not surprise you that Design processes do not actually stem from Graphic or Visual design, but rather from engineering. James Garret defined a linear process in his book "Design and Technology", which today is implemented in most classic tech- and engineering companies. 

A product development will go through the stages of analysis, research, definition, creation, selection, prototyping, testing and finally a report. While the industry model is quite engineering-focussed, it forms the basic structure that almost all design processes are shaped after today.

On the flipside though, Garret’s way of developing products lacks flexibility, makes it hard to adapt to changed to changed circumstances and – deal breaker – makes it almost impossible to estimate how long the development will take. 

# Design Lifecycle

Enter the Design Lifecycle. Rooted in software development, the design lifecycle is basically a shortened version of the industry model – cutting out the research and report parts. 

- steps

As the name says, the design lifecycle acknowledges the fact that you probably will not get the perfect product at the first round. The process is built on iteration. Rinse and repeat. There is no timeframe defined, however most implementations today seek orientation in usual Agile sprints, making the design lifecycle one or two weeks long. How long each phase of the cycle takes is up to the team running it. While the repetition may help to produce and build results instead of perfecting them, it is still easy to get lost in the details in a design lifecycle. 

# Design Thinking

Adapted and pushed forward by IDEO founder David M. Kelley, Design Thinking is probably a term that comes up most today when talking about design processes. Unlike popular belief, Design Thinking is not exactly a well-defined process, but rather a toolbox of methods and principles that can be instrumentalised when coming up with solutions for problems.

Deisgn Thinking puts the user in the center of the process, rather than the product or brand. It encourages designers to experiment and push the boundaries of their current knowledges to create new solutions. Most Design Thinking implementations are a team effort – working together when coming up with new solutions is a key principle of the toolbox.
