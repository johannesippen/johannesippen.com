# Design Process Battle: Which One is the Best? 

{% image /img/blog/design-process/design-process.jpg %}

Great products don’t get cranked out – they’re a result of structured work. Starting with a briefing and diving right might look very courageous, but sure won’t bring you far. Product design is not about immersive dedication, it is about having a really good process.

What does a good design process look like? And what can we learn from successful agencies and tech companies like Apple and Google? 

Over the years, design process have developed and evolved, coming from a very straight and formal process to the fast-paced agile methods we know and use today. In this article, I will walk you through some of the most popular design processes, figure out their strengths and weaknesses and maybe, just maybe, give you a bit of an overview.

## The Classic: Seven Steps

{% image /img/blog/design-process/seven-steps.jpg %}

It might not surprise you that Design processes do not actually stem from Graphic or Visual design, but rather from engineering. James Garret defined a linear process in his book "Design and Technology", which today is implemented in most classic tech- and engineering companies. 

The idea is simple: a product development goes through a fixed set of stages, and at the end, you will have (or not have) a finished product. These stages are:

1. Analysis - Figure out what the problem is
2. Research - Learn more about it
3. Definition - Describe the challenge
4. Creation - Generate ideas
5. Selection - Identify the best ones
6. Prototype - Build it
7. Testing - See if it works
8. Report - Document what you did

### The Goods

- Straight-forward and very easy to communicate
- Fits into most company structures and cultures
- Even if it fails, some documentation is built in - makes it easy to learn for next round

### The Bads

- Very linear process - leaves no room for iteration or milestones
- No timelines defined - makes estimation impossible
- Leaves participants alone with creation and decision making, provides little to no help
- Lack in flexibility 

## The Shorter One: Design Lifecycle

Enter the Design Lifecycle. Rooted in software development, the design lifecycle is basically a shortened version of the industry model – cutting out the research and report parts. 

As the name says, the design lifecycle acknowledges the fact that you probably will not get the perfect product at the first round. The process is built on iteration. Rinse and repeat. There is no timeframe defined, however most implementations today seek orientation in usual Agile sprints, making the design lifecycle one or two weeks long. 

### The Goods

- Repetition helps to produce and build results instead of perfecting them
- Great for tech startups
- Very little documentation overhead necessary

### The Bads

- Still easy to get lost in timeline or details
- Can be frustrating if lifecycle needs too many iterations
- Enables a "we tried this before" culture

## The Buzzword: Design Thinking

Adapted and pushed forward by IDEO founder David M. Kelley, Design Thinking is probably a term that comes up most today when talking about design processes. Unlike popular belief, Design Thinking is not exactly a well-defined process, but rather a toolbox of methods and principles that can be instrumentalised when coming up with solutions for problems.

Deisgn Thinking puts the user in the center of the process, rather than the product or brand. It encourages designers to experiment and push the boundaries of their current knowledges to create new solutions. Most Design Thinking implementations are a team effort – working together when coming up with new solutions is a key principle of the toolbox.

### The Goods

- Enables team culture and innovation mindset
- Very flexible and adaptable to business cases
- Allows for experiments
- Under constant development and improvement

### The Bads

- Not a defined process
- Buzzwordy - easy to fall for so-called "Design Thinking" experts 

## The Darwinist: Creative Selection

What would Apple do? What's the process behind creating the iPod or iPhone? According to Apple-alumni Ken Kocienda, the magic in many of the hyped products from Cupertino lies in it's unique Darwinist approach. He calls this process "Creative Selection".

It works like the following: Any idea gets turned into a working demo, something you can touch or interact with. If you are unsure about a feature or have multiple ideas, the team builds multiple demos. Every once in a while, these feature prototypes get presented to the big decision-maker, back in the days Steve Jobs of course. Based on the demo, he would decide which way to go or how to follow up and evolve the feature. 

If things went smoothly, every team would focus on their field of expertise and research. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the teams, they could all be assigned to work on the same issue and create many many demos tot choose from.

### The Goods

- Creative Selection works amazing if you are building and researching something completely new
- Getting a very clear experience of what the final product might feel and look like
- Great process to draw focus on only the best ideas and simplify as much as possible

### The Bads

- Works for huge companies with lots of ressources and ideas to try
- Only works with a visionary decision-maker like Steve Jobs
- Can create rivalry between designers and teams

## The Cool Kid: Design Sprint

{% image /img/blog/design-process/design-sprint.jpg %}

Design Sprints are a five step, five day design process, based on Design Thinking Methods. The Process has been developed at Google Ventures and is implemented in many innovative companies like LEGO, xx and xx today. Rather than being an everyday process, the intention of a Design Sprint (not to be confused with Agile Sprints) is intended to generate rapid learnings and eliminate Business Risk. "Sprint" author Jake Knapp describes it as "Taking a look into the future".

Design Sprints are usually run in a workshop format over the course of a work week:

- Day 1: Research
- Day 2: Ideation
- Day 3: Decide
- Day 4: Prototype
- Day 5: Test

At the end of the week, workshop participants have evaluated a business problem, have come up with several potential solutions and have prototyped and tested the most promising ones. Due to its massive success in the tech and service industry, different sprint models have evolved out of the original process, like the Design Sprint 2.0, which can be run in 4 days, or the New Factors Design Sprint, which generates feasable results within a 3 hours.

### The Goods

- Very fast results, look into the future
- Omits pointless discussions
- Outcome always guaranted
- Adaptable and proven

### The Bads

- doesnt fit all
- needs experienced facilitation
