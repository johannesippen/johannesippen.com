# Can a Product be too good?

- Using Skype in the office
- Got worse and worse

- Facebook making addictive products
- Are they trying to be evil?
- I know Facebook developers, they don’t
- So why do they do that?
- To understand why, you need to understand how these are measured
- Retention, Session Length, and Engagement
- The more, the better
- Because they are ad-based
- But still with products as a service, they want you to come back
- The best way to this is: provide very good features
- ANd this is where it gets sticky

- We switched from Skype to Slack
- We were relatively early doing this
- I used it before in a remote team
- But out of a sudden, 250 people

- It had great features
- Searchability
- Groups/Channels
- File transfers
- Plugins

- It didn’t just replace Skype, it replaced personal conversation
- Chatting with people right next to you
- Building a bias/anxiety to walk over

- Yet the way we communicated remained relatively the same
- informal language, conversational style
- Or a simple "Hi, you there? Ping me when you're at your desk"
- From 10% of my day in chats I raised to 40-50% of my day communicating in written form
- making me less productive

- And that is the thing: When a product replaces a habit, does it also improve the lifestyle or does it come at a cost?
- Can products be too good?
