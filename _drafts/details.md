# Delightful Details

Xxx. After xxx kilometers and 3 days in a tiny capsule, a tiny detail almost killed the first 2 men on the moon. What happened?

> “Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.”

On July 20, shortly past 8PM, the lunar module arrived safely on the surface of our moon. After Eight years of research, design, development and endless tests and over 75 hours of flight, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin are ready to take the first steps on the moon. 

Too excited to sleep but yet exhausted, the two men decide to take a walk on the moon now, not later. They do as they rehearsed so many times: Get in their space suits, attach the live modules, put on the big helmets and depressurize the tiny caspule. And then it happens: While turning towards to exit vault, one of the men makes an unlucky move. Unheard in the vaccuum of the airless pod, his heavy backpack breaks of a tiny switch on Eagle’s dashboard: The ascent engine circuit breaker.

> “Mission Control verified that the switch was open, meaning that the engine was currently unarmed. If we could not get the engine armed, we could be stranded on the Moon.” – [Buzz Aldrin](http://www.cnbc.com/id/42592372) 

With an unthoughtful movement, the astronauts just signed their death sentence. A tiny detail, unrecognized by engineers, project managers and dashboard designers could turn the greatest achievement of the 20th century into a national tragedy. A tiny detail that is about to kill two men.

> The devil is in the details.

In digital product design, we often speak about MVPs. Minimum Viable Products. A version of a product that contains only the minimal feature set, unfinished, unpolished, undetailed. Yet the idea is clear: Get an idea of the finished product, take a glimpse into the future.

MVPs are a great way to iterate on your product and to test the most basic feature set, but they are missing a big thing: Details.

- A details can make the difference (how)

-but details make difference
-unsuccessful withoutndetails
- details can delight!
- make a joyful experience
- great examples:

## Example One: Making more of the information

- Date in Email
- Phone number in email
- no attachment (making more of information)
- Google Mail without those details would just be email

## Example Two: Make more of unused space

- Medium Favicon (using an unused element)

## Example Three: Delight me!

- Spotify Lightsaber (adding a layer)

Details are an important element of UX Design. If you get the details right, you can change the face of the product. A detail can make the difference between a version of an existing product or a complete new standard. Details, more than ever, deserve our full attention. And there’s no reason why details cannot be part of the MVP: Being aware of the potential impact one can have, they can be evaluated early on.

Luckily, details in digital product cannot kill people. What about Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin? Almost killed by a detail, they were also saved by a detail:

When equipping the Apollo Shuttle, NASA decided to equip the astronauts with Duro Felt tip pens, a normal marker with a metal cap. This exact metal cap served Aldrin as a replacement switch: He engaged the engine with the cap of his pen.

Details can save lives. Or at least make our lives better. What kind of detail do you like? Any detail that changed the way you use a product? Let me know on Twitter: @johannesippen
