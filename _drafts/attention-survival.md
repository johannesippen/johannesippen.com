- Short explanation
- You find something that you might disagree
- However, the likelyhood that you are getting trolled is quite high
- Jens Spahn story
- Although he couldn’t disagree more with his views, he actually boosted him
- This is how social media and attention economy work
- How to state your views without giving people the exposure?

# 1. Look at the context

- Why would they do this?
- Is it election?
- Do they want to distract from something?
- If you find it, take notice of the context instead

# 2. Don’t Like or Comment

- If you do, the post will get boosted in their feed
- It will get exposed to your friends
- This is how feed-centered media works, not only facebook
- Never interact with the post!

# 3. Don’t share it!

- Don’t share. That's what they want.
- That brings ppl to their channel
- Trixi story
- Stupid tweets that would be picked up by the media
- Only to get her in
- excuse afterwards
- If you need to share a quote, make a screenshot instead

# 4. Don’t mention their name

- That's what they want
- Use a description instead
- pixel them out in their screenshot

# 5. Don’t be against it, be in favor of something else instead

- Hold up your values instead of arguing theirs.
- Control the situation
- Kleiner5 instead of focussing on German populists

- This works well for almost every topic
- Buzzy news: Mimikama Facts instead of denying story
- Terrorism: Focus on human values instead of sensationalist views

- Infographic

- Media competency is important
- Don’t give in people free exposure
- Go vote
