# Lets talk about Fun

"Make it fun!" — "can you gamify this?" — when it comes to UI/UX design, having an enjoyable interface seems to be more important than ever. A fun interface is not only a gimmick, but a real pr kmoduct differenciator. But what makes interfaces fun?

Let's start with a common misconception: Fun is not funny. It has nothibg to do with telling jokes, cool animations or quirky characters. Fun interfaces are no cartoon versions of an interface, they are not immersive worlds and by no means they are Microdoft Bob.

Microsoft Bob was a version of the Microsoft desktop tat heavily celebrated the desktop metaphor. In this version of windoes, intended for kids and the elderly, … complete with file cabinet, trashcan and a window you could look out. The user was guided by a Little dog called Rover. 

Bob had just one issue: as cutr and quirkx as it was, users hated it. It was basically unusable, complicated and way to annoxing to perform everyday tasks. And it certainly was no fun to use. 

So how does fun work?

According to Raph Koster, author of "A theory of fun", fun is mostly the resukt of a learning experience. When we learn and amke progress, we experience a kind of joy that we associate with fun. 

To me, the most important characteristics abotu fun are:

## Interaction & Feedback

Fun is about Feedback and Interactions. Interfaces that invite you to be touched and that react to this. Both in small and in big scale. Macrofeedback and Microfeedback.

A great example for Macrofeedback is the Material Design Showcase: clear big interfave elements, the primary buttons and touchable elements clearly stand out.

Microsoft Bob had none of those. Characters lacked personality, the interface metaphors where supermuch in your face, the feedback level was not well executed. They tried to make a fun product, but failed. Steve Ballmer said: "". The product was canceled.
