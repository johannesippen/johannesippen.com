# Book Recommendation for UX Designers

{% image /img/blog/books_steve_krug.jpg %}

A few days a reader of my book "[Web Fatale](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/3836238985/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johannesippen-21&camp=1638&creative=6742&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=3836238985&linkId=b25b95e25d83e4105600efb04cac42d7)" wrote me, enthusiastically telling me that he read the whole book – from cover to cover. That alone is pretty impressive, not even my mom did that.

But he soaked it up – every single bit of it, and he wanted more. So he asked me if I had any further reading recommendations, especially for people who aspire to create usable and seductive websites. Digital products that you couldn’t resist. I never thought about it before, but I had – lots actually! And I want to share them.

So, in the tradition of [High Fidelity](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0826453252/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johannesippen-21&camp=1638&creative=6742&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0826453252&linkId=799072d96f21c81b2f7868565aeed1f0), here’s my Top 5 books every UX Designer should have read:

## [Steve Krug - Don’t Make Me Think](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0321965515/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johannesippen-21&camp=1638&creative=6742&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0321965515&linkId=5d18ce4cc0856fc9141b9054f8667b3f)

When I started my job as a designer at Wooga, our CEO Jens made me (and everyone else who was new) read this book. It’s a quick one, filled with a lot of very simple truths. Steve Krug manages to break down the essence of digital usability into something that is easy to relate, entertaining and memorable. I still consult the book, which has been reissued and updated a few times, every now and then. The best part: This is not only for designers but for everyone. Get a copy for your project manager, your developers, and your clients, too – they will thank you!

- **Great for**: Designers, colleagues and clients 
- **Where to get**: ["Don’t make me think" on Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0321965515/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johannesippen-21&camp=1638&creative=6742&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0321965515&linkId=5d18ce4cc0856fc9141b9054f8667b3f)

## [Stephen Anderson – Seductive Interaction Design](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0321725522/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johannesippen-21&camp=1638&creative=6742&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0321725522&linkId=59d638e7b62405455ae87fb3069482c2)

Stephen P Anderson’s book is one of the greatest inspirations for me. Filled with loads and loads of examples, it’s like an encyclopedia of digital experience and UX best practices. I read the book from 2009 on the beach of a Spanish island – it's so hard to deal with all the inspiration when there is no computer near to execute on it. The downside of this book: Most of the examples feel a bit old and dated now in 2017 – nostalgic even. Anyway, that doesn't make them less valuable.

- **Great for**: Inspiration 
- **Where to get**: [Seductive Interaction Design on Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0321725522/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johannesippen-21&camp=1638&creative=6742&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0321725522&linkId=59d638e7b62405455ae87fb3069482c2)

{% image /img/blog/books_don_norman.jpg %}

## [Don Norman – The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0465050654/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johannesippen-21&camp=1638&creative=6742&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0465050654&linkId=ab3966fe2adca19e3ca2612310b20178)

Don Norman is a cognitive scientist and usability engineer who tries to see the big picture. The book is a lot about doors and door handles – and as interesting as full of wisdom. You should read this if you want to take a deep-dive into how the human brain works when interacting with any kind of object - not only digital products.

- **Great for**: A deep understanding of design

## [Raph Koster – A Theory of Fun](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1449363210/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johannesippen-21&camp=1638&creative=6742&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1449363210&linkId=ed9385b4964185171c6d9c0614380b86)

I remember how I picked up Raph Koster’s book for the first time: I was waiting for a colleague to finish his work before we headed out for dinner. This took only 10 minutes, and in the meantime, I made through half the book. Although targetted towards game designers, A Theory of Fun is a must-read for everyone. The great part: The book is split in half, the left side explains the content through cartoony illustrations, while the right part is long-copy. This makes it not only fast to read, but also – fun.

- **Great for**: Casual reading & learning 
- **Where to get**: [Enjoy A Theory of Fun on Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1449363210/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johannesippen-21&camp=1638&creative=6742&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1449363210&linkId=ed9385b4964185171c6d9c0614380b86)

## [Chris Anderson – FREE](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00XV3Q124/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johannesippen-21&camp=1638&creative=6742&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00XV3Q124&linkId=8cab3b3b4c365e51234f543e96f14154)

Nobody understands the figures behind the modern internet better than Chris Anderson. The author of "[The Long Tail](https://www.amazon.de/Long-Tail-Future-Business-Selling/dp/1401309666/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1504081461&sr=8-2&keywords=the+long+tail&linkCode=ll1&tag=johannesippen-21&linkId=1dcd8aa7d54bf32657c25e837babaf18)" explains pricing models of the Freemium economy. Although the book seems a bit depressing at first sight, it is full of "Aha"-moments. If you ever wondered how companies like Dropbox can offer you free storage, read this!

- **Great for**: Business 
- **Where to get**: [FREE on Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00XV3Q124/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johannesippen-21&camp=1638&creative=6742&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00XV3Q124&linkId=8cab3b3b4c365e51234f543e96f14154)

All the above links are Amazon Affiliate links – I hope you don’t mind! I'm trying this for the first time, also with the premise of keeping this publication ad-free. Let’s see how that works.

I cannot close this article without mentioning my own book: If you want a good summary of what makes seductive web design great and seductive, you might wanna take a peek into Web Fatale:
