# Science in Visual Design

- Art school.

Design is not art. Design is not about beauty. As designers, we research and solve problems. We develop systems and solutions. 

- design is not art
- design is not beauty
- design is about systems
- some basics
- psychology and math
- here is my favourites

## Fibonacci numbers

Leonardo Bonacci, better known as "the most talented Western mathematician of the Middle Ages", or short Fibonacci introduced Europe to a [sequence](https://3.7designs.co/blog/2010/10/how-to-design-using-the-fibonacci-sequence/) of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones:

1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144, …

The beauty of this sequence is that it’s an almost exact representation of the Golden Ratio – which is perceived to be the most harmonious ratio by most people.

This comes in handy if you need a harmonious relation between 2 elements, for example if you’re creating font size hierarchies or element sizes. A button that is 55 pixels high and 89 pixels wide will appear surprisingly harmonious – science!

## Millers Number

The full title of George A. Millers publication is the perfect summary: "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information". Miller states that the human brain has short-term memory capacity of 7±2 information chunks.

Even though there are newer findings that state that the human brain can store much more information in an episodic buffer, the 7±2 theory is still a really good reminder to keep blocks of information compact.

## Fitts Law

The formula looks really complicated:

{\text{MT}}=a+b\cdot {\text{ID}}=a+b\cdot \log _{2}{\Bigg (}{\frac {2D}{W}}{\Bigg )}

What the law, coined in 1954 by psychologist Paul Fitts, predicts is that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target. Main take away for UI/UX design:

If you want the user to successfully hit a button, you need to make it bigger – or get it closer to the user’s finger. Basically, Fitts’ Law is the key essence of onscreen usability.

- Operant conditioning
- Continuous
- Interval
- Fixed Interval
- Variable Interval
- Ratio Schedules
- Fixed/Variable
