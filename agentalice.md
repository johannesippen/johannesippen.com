# <small>Case Study</small> Agent Alice

Together with my team at Wooga, I created a compelling launch package for the Hidden Object Smash Hit Agent Alice.

As a successor to Wooga’s great success Pearl’s Peril, Agent Alice was planned as a mobile-first casual game experience. Set in the 1960s, Alice Wallace is a tough independent female detective – investigating mysterious criminal cases while empowering an audience all over the world.

But how do you market a game like that? 

Looking at the direct and indirect competition, we identified 3 potential directions: 1) A crime theme, comparable to detective franchises like CSI: or Criminal Case 2) a mystery theme, found in long-lasting IPs like The X-Files 3) A story theme, centered around approachable character relationships – like in soap operas and telenovelas.

To find out which of these directions resonates the best with our audience, we built and tested all of them, utilizing focus groups, click tests and a split test store simulator.

Turned out – our mostly female audience prefered the warmer tones of the latter variant. While remaining a mystery crime game, it still was all about the story.

## Logo & Brand

We set out to create a logomark that transports the idea of the game in a subtle way, but also fits the graphic design of the 1960s. We picked up the Futura typeface from the user interface and tried various graphic ideas and treatments to convey the overall idea. The final product ended up being much more minimalist than we anticipated – and worked like a charm with the busy Hidden Object backgrounds.

## Launch Package

The app icon process always starts with an idea. For a game like Agent Alice, we would usually have not only one idea, but over 60 of them. In close cooperation with the game team, we develop 2 dozens of them and test a handful, until we are sure we found the best possible Home Screen representation for the app.

> "Everything in the launch package is very polished and very consistent – a major reason for the success of the launch campaign." *— Jens Begemann, CEO*

Based on the brand work, we assembled a nice package for the Agent Alice launch, including app screenshots, banner creatives, video creatives, feature graphics, game merch. We worked on a cinematic trailer with Ichi from London and several Making-ofs with our internal PR & communications team.
