Let’s start with the obvious question: Why would you want to reinvent the mobile phone in 2024? We do have established brands, iterations over iterations of hardware, 

It is impossible to think of a life without the smartphone. Having a device in our pockets that organizes our days, entertains us and enables us to create and share - so versatile, and yet it has a core issue: The modern smartphone is a device that everything well, but nothing great.

In this concept, I will try to answer the question: What if one the greatest designers of all time had created a phone.

all kind of audiences use the same device. no matter if you are a creator, a gamer or a housewife, you are all using the same device

Following the teachings of Rams and the concept of Brauncore, I asked myself: How would a Braun Phone look like

Less but better. Make its dedicated job better?

Useful & understandable?

We identified 3 target audiences and create not one, but 3 very distinct phones

## The Essential

The Essential is the perfect everyday phone. Smaller than most contemporary smartphones, it is truly pocketable. Smartz power management and a meticulous focus on the most important features allow it to stay on for days.

We designed The Essential to be your everyday companion – the place for your digital wallet, your tickets and access codes, your shopping list and reminders. 

The phone borrows features and design details from the Braun era, making it simple and joyful to use. Not matter if you write an email, organize your day or make a quick phone call.

Made from airplane-grade aluminium, The Essential is an instant classic design icon. From the angle of the rounded screen corners to the haptic side buttons and screw-mounted back plate, The Essential is full of lovely design details waiting to be discovered.

The second phone in the lineup comes with a twist: It does feature an amazing stabilized 108MP camera – pointing to the front, not the back. The Creator is the first phone ever to feature an exclusive flagship selfie camera. 

Accompanied by a built-in condensor microphone, this makes it the perfect setup for vlogging, streaming, video conferencing or just taking selfies.

The Creator is not for everyone – it is a phone specifically designed for you, the creator community. For the first time, you are able to create high quality imaginery of yourself while monitoring yourself, on the device you edit and post your content.

The Creator comes with a magnetic snap-on action camera mount, which is compatible with most action cam accessories, making it compatible with you existing camera gear.

The smart button on the side of the device lets you snap photos, video or shorts without having to open the dedicated app: Tap the button once to take a selfie, double-tap to record a video or hold to record a 15 second short.

Obviously, The Creator features a full Android with Brauncore UI, which allows you to use it as a regular phone.
