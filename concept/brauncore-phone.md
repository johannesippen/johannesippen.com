A new generation of phone

Problem: A device that does everything okayish, but nothing great

all kind of audiences use the same device. no matter if you are a creator, a gamer or a housewife, you are all using the same device

Following the teachings of Rams and the concept of Brauncore, I asked myself: How would a Braun Phone look like

Less but better. Make its dedicated job better?

Useful & understandable?

We identified 3 target audiences and create not one, but 3 very distinct phones

## The Essential

true pocket device

Smart power management and focus

everyday companion

the place for your wallet, your qr codes, your shopping lists and reminders

Made from airplane-grade aluminium

borrows a lot of details from the Braun era
