# Speaking at CreativeMornings

I usually never write posts about my talks, but this one was special, so I decided to make an exception this time. 

[CreativeMornings](https://creativemornings.com/about) is a series of talks, started in 2008 by Tina Roth Eisenberg in New York. Since then, it has spread out to over 161 cities worldwide, including my hometown Berlin.

Having attended CreativeMornings a dozen times and even hosted it at the Wooga office, it was quite an honor to me to speak at CreativeMornings in November 2016.

My talk "Web Fatale" was based on my book with the same title, which has been published earlier in 2016 in German language. This talk was a great opportunity to transform the content and the message into English and make it accessible for a bigger audience. But see for yourself:

What makes CreativeMornings different from other events is the people – both on the organiser side as well as in the audience. It does not feel like speaking to an anonymous conference crowd, but more like a big breakfast round of like-minded creatives. Not few of them are regulars, who attend every CreativeMornings session, which gives it a bit of a family vibe.

This is mostly thanks to the really good organisation, headed by Jürgen and Franziska, who are also responsible for the [TYPO conference](http://www.typotalks.com/). Especially cool are the pictures taken by the talented Norman Posselt on the morning of the event - check out more on [the CreativeMornings BER Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/berlin_creativemornings/sets/72157675215607771).

The best thing for me is the reactions of people that I get in person but also via Email, Facebook and Twitter. [Somebody](https://twitter.com/RonnyViete/status/816656032634171396) even made a GIF of the confetti canons we shot in the audience!

Thank you everyone who was part of the experience – it was a blast, looking forward to next time!
