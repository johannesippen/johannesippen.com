«Where can I go in Berlin where founders can meet designers, product people or just get inspired?» – after getting this question again today, I decided to gather a quick list of my favourite upcoming events in Berlin and Berlin-like cities closeby (kind of). Here’s some events not to miss this spring:

## Feb 28: [Überstunde Berlin](https://ueberstunde.com/berlin)

Überstunde (German: Overtime) is an after work event for startup people with a low-key West Berlin vibe to it. If you want to meet interesting people, have a drink and some snacks, Überstunde might be THE networking event for you. 

## Mar 4: [Berlin Product Designers Meetup](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bpd25-designing-search-ux-in-2024-with-vitaly-friedman-tickets-846051632207)

This edition of Product Designers Meetup features an industry veteran: Smashing Magazine founder Vitaly Friedman talks about designing search interfaces – make sure to get your tickets on time!

## Mar 12: [OutGeek Women x Berlin](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/women-in-tech-berlin-outgeekwomen-tickets-740985376207)

Celebrate International Women’s Day with female industry talents from Berlin. Hosted by Blacklane, you have the chance to meet amazing designers, developers or data scientists.

## Mar 14: [Type Thursday](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/type-thursday-berlin-march-14-2024-tickets-850310881737)

For type lovers and letter nerds, Type Thursday is kind of the heir of the world-famous «TYPO» conference, which was discontiued in 2018. While you can just enjoy the evening and listen to a couple of interesting talks, there’s also a slot to present your own projects at Type Thursday.

## Mar 20/21: [UX Copenhagen](https://uxcopenhagen.com/)

Not quite Berlin, UX Copenhagen is probably one the most future-forward industry events, branding itsself as [Human Experience](/2019/humans-not-users/) conference. The mix of international and local speakers makes worth attending not only for scandinavian designers.

## Apr 4-6: [OFFF Barcelona](https://www.offf.barcelona/)

Probably one of my favourite design events in the whole world returns in April. OFFF is not only a great, affordable and inspiring event in the heart of Barcelona, but also a laid-back gathering, where you randomly bump into design legends like [Erik Spiekermann](/2019/erik-spiekermann/) or David Carson.
