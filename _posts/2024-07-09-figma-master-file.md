This video will cover how to create and utilize a Figma Master File for design projects. I'll walk you through structuring the file with separate pages for assets like logos, colors, typography, and components. You'll learn how a Master File allows for consistent branding across multiple projects by centralizing your design elements. The file can contain styles for colors, text, wireframes, and image fills, providing an overview to share with your team.
