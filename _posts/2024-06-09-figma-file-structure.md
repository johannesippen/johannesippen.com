I am really excited to share this with you! To zoom out a bit: I use Figma as my main design tool, no matter if it is a app design, web design, branding or even print product. 

In this video, I will cover my Figma file structure and pages organisation. I will walk you through my design process for a branding and app design project, from research through concept to final design and asset export. You will learn how following this design process and organisation method will streamline your design and reduce clutter in your design work.
