Canva. 

- Used by hobbyists
- Lots of templates, rather ugly
- But why serious?

- Canva Create 2024

Here are the reasons I believe 

1. It’s not trying to compete, but redefine

- It's not aiming for design functions, but rather companies with design-focus
- Marketing, Sales, HR, 
- Rather replace MS Office

2. Workflow Wins.

- Like Adobe DTP workflow or Sketch-Zeplin Integration or Figma-Inspect Mode
- Canva is trying to go from idea to execution
- Whiteboard, presentation

3. It still looks ugly, but that is about to change

- If someone sets up Canva right, you get a powerhouse for design-focussed companies
- No more gate-keeping
